Assumptions:
  - That "nearby" markets are markets that are in the same zip code.
  - That the user wants the full details of a market's schedule, since most
    markets in the API do not have up-to-date schedules.
  - The details from the weather forecast the user wants.
  - That the user wants the forecast on a per-zip code basis, showing the next
    three days' weather since market schedule data is too unreliable.
  - That the client wanted minimal styling of the web page.

My choice of HTML, Javascript and jQuery was only moderately well suited for this
task. The simplicity of the USDA API in combination with the asynchronous nature
of AJAX calls made the retrieval and proper formatting of all market details
on initial submission of a zip code too cumbersome to implement.

That is why I chose to prompt the user to click a Details button to view details
on a market, using native jQuery UI for simplicity's sake.
